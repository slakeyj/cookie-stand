This is a website that creates a table of data.  I've created a constructor function to allow creation of each store.  The website loads with 5 stores already in place in the data.  The user has the ability to input more stores in form which is then added to the end of the table with new data.

An index.html page has been added ass the public facing page.  It contains information about the Salmon Cookies Business.
